Hello! I'm an ML research engineer based in the United Kingdom. I currently work at [Monumo](https://monumo.com), where I research and implement novel machine learning and generative AI methods to optimize and design electric motors. 

I love technology and am passionate about clean, low-cost, and abundant energy for all. Within this sphere, my career is oriented around scientific machine learning and new technologies driving emerging value chains. 

Outside of work, I'm an active member of the [Explorer's Club](https://www.explorers.org), and have provided research mentorship services for high school and undergraduate students since 2017.
