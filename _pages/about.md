Hello! I'm an ML research engineer based in the United Kingdom. I currently work at [Monumo](https://monumo.com), where I research and implement novel machine learning and generative AI methods to optimize and design electric motors. 

I love technology and am passionate about clean, low-cost, and abundant energy for all. Within this sphere, my career is oriented around scientific machine learning and new technologies driving emerging value chains. 

Outside of work, I'm an active member of the [Explorer's Club](https://www.explorers.org), and have provided research mentorship services for high school and undergraduate students since 2017. 

Check out my [blog](https://chris-hull.com/blog/), where I am starting to learn in public.

Chris Hull is an Energy Systems engineer affiliated with the [Energy and Power Group (EPG)](https://epg.eng.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford, where he researches the electrification of public transportation systems in Sub-Saharan Africa under Professor Malcolm McCulloch. He previously studied environmental economics at Stanford University, and is focused on developing solutions for achieving net-zero in an economically feasible way. Chris is driven by his passion for cutting-edge technological and market solutions that enable clean, low-cost, and abundant energy for all. 

Chris has been involved in engineering and economic research on four different continents since 2018, and looks forward to continuing to work on the world's most pressing problems with the world's brightest minds. He is excited about possibilities for new technologies to drive emerging value chains.  -->
