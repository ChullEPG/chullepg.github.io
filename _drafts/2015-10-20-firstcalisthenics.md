This is my first post about movement.

(Below is spark notes, write better later)

I had surgery two years ago to fix pain issues. But I'm still in pain. Some days I can kind of run, some days I can't at all. This isn't a complaint, this is motivation for me to train my body to move better and move without pain.

I've tried various approaches including the ATG system (link), stuff on Jeff Cavalier's channel, and working in real life with many physiotherapists. Nothing has given me real lasting change. However i've been blocked at really making a difference in my movement by competing in rowing. When you're putting the body under enough physical stress as you do on a rigorous rowing training schedule, it has trouble making other adaptations. It can only adapt so much at once.

One thing I've never tried is going wholeheartedly in on flexibililty and bodyweight strength/ability. I think this might help/be a good idea, because a) I've always had some mobility/flexibility issues and b) if I can control my own bodyweight well, then I should be able to move without pain right? 

I wabeen watching a lot of [Tom Merrick](https://www.youtube.com/@BodyweightWarrior) videos recently.
