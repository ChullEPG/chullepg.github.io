Hi! Welcome to my blog. The intention of this blog is to give myself a platform to learn in public, and a place to organize my thoughts on random topics. 

I recently found myself at a place in life where I am a beginner in pretty much everything I do throughout the day. I have a long journey ahead of me in all of these areas, which consist of both hobbies and work, until I can achieve a meaningful level of proficiency. So, I thought it would be cool to give myself a platform to document my journey. All sorts of people post their progress in all sorts of pursuits all over the internet, and it seems like both documenting and sharing your efforts are probably rewarding things to do. So this site is me giving it a go. It might be interesting because it includes a variety of pursuits in parallel, not just one thing at a time.

Additionally, I love learning and have been a fairly regular journaler for a number of years now. I tend to write entries on topics that interest me, but I don't write as much as I'd like to write. I think that having this blog and committing to some sort of regular schedule will encourage me to organize my thoughts and write them down more. This could include any topic. I don't really expect anybody to ever read it besides maybe my mom, so I will consider that a bonus if it happens! 

I'm not entirely sure yet of everything that this blog will consist of. However, some things I know I'm going to post about include the following: 
1. Learning to play the piano (link to first post)
2. Flexibility / Calisthenics (link to first post)
3. ML/AI research & engineering concepts (link to first post)
4. Learning systems (link to first post)
5. Random thoughts (link to first post)


Knowing myself, this blog is most likely to fail if I tackle too many things at once. So I'm going to keep it pretty minimal to start with and introduce more later on. Going by the principle that if i I'm not adding things in, I'm not deleting enough. It doesn't make sense I'm forsaking progress in these things becausae I'm thinking too much about what to post, what order to post, etc.
