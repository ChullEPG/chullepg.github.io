Passive courses/references (passive vs. active):
1. YouTube lecture series 
-- e.g. Rethinking Statistics courses
2. Bayesian Methods for Hackers
3. OpenAI spinning up in DeepRL 


Active courses
1. Udacity
2. Coursera 


Other
1. Random PRs on GitHub
2. Building my own ML project
3. Contributing to HuggingFace
4. Finding papers and implementing them
5. Kaggle competitions 

Collaborative
1. Hackathons (in-person and virtual)
2. Weekly paper groups (e.g. on Discord) (attend or present)
3. In-person meetups

Project Ideas
1. Multi-GPU. Reproduce answer.ai's ModernBert and intentinoally use FSDP to use two GPUs on a machine. Extension: do it across two workstations (learn multi-node training). [fdsp](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html) if not ModernBert, maybe GPT2 following andrey karpathy's work
2. Practice fine-tuning SD3 with LORA or Q-LORA. Pick 100 or 1000 images and finetune it (maybe even need to quantise to fit on GPU). May need to ask for cloud access and get an A100 which would build skills on moving data to the cloud. Maybe pick some meme images that would be funny. If not SD3, then the flux models from black forest (need some model with open weights).


General learning
1. Blogging about concepts that interest me 
2. Answer questions on Reddit, Twitter, Discord (or ask questions)
3. Generally reading stuff that's available online and/or interacting with it
